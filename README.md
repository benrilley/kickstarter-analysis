# Kickstarting with Excel
## For this project we were assigned to help our friend, Louise. Louise's passionate and steamy new play *Fever* is gearing up to set box offices ablaze. There was just one small problem... how can she afford to put it on? 
### Louise wanted to crowdfund her play so we were tasked with analyzing data from more than 4,000 individual Kickstarter campaigns to identify key trends and help come up with a competitive fundraising strategy.
## Analysis and Challenges 
### We filtered the data for specifically theatrical productions and further more, the months in which the shows were put on.

### There's a couple observations supported by the data collected. Louise was nervous about moving forward with her show. The first thing we highlighted to her was that plays succeed nearly twice as often as they fail, year round. There was nothing to be afraid of. The peak window for success according to our model was late spring/early summer. 
### The other graph made was the total outcomes based on the funding goal.

### The key takeaway here is the plays that had the smallest funding goals saw the most success on average. Setting your funding goal at $25,000 gives you a near 50% higher chance of failure than a goal of $5,000.
