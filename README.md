# Kickstarting with Excel
## For this project we were assigned to help our friend, Louise. Louise's passionate and steamy new play *Fever* is gearing up to set box offices ablaze. There was just one small problem... how can she afford to put it on? 
### Louise wanted to crowdfund her play so we were tasked with analyzing data from more than 4,000 individual Kickstarter campaigns to identify key trends and help come up with a competitive fundraising strategy.
## Analysis and Challenges 
### We filtered the data for specifically theatrical productions and further more, the months in which the shows were put on.

### There's a couple observations supported by the data collected. Louise was nervous about moving forward with her show. The first thing we highlighted to her was that plays succeed nearly twice as often as they fail, year round. There was nothing to be afraid of. The peak window for success according to our model was late spring/early summer. 
### The other graph made was the total outcomes based on the funding goal.

### The key takeaway here is the plays that had the smallest funding goals saw the most success on average. Setting your funding goal at $25,000 gives you a near 50% higher chance of failure than a goal of $5,000. 
## Challenges and Difficulties 
### I would say I grasped most of the concepts that went into this project pretty well. The one thing that reall threw me for a loop was the =COUNTIFS. I spent a good three hours trying to figure out where I was going wrong and it was extremely frustrating. I watched at least three youtube videos and the tutorial video on the module but I eventually got there. 
## Conclusions 
### Launch Date: As I stated previously, launches in the late spring/early summer saw the most success. Outside of summertime success if a launch isn't possible then, February saw a summer-level spike, so presumably a Valetines Day weekend launch should prove to be successful. 
### Outcomes based on Goals: Again, as I stated previously, the productions that set out seeking the least money were the most successful. Assumptiously due to ability to do more with less and the power of reasonable expectations, every production isn't going to be *Wicked* on Broadway. 

### Some limitations of this data set are that its relatively small. A better analysis could be given with more data, over more years. 
### I can't think of any better graphs to include for this assignment. Compared to Outcomes vs goals and theater outcomes vs launch, everything I could think of seemed redundant or impractical.
