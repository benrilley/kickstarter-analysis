# Kickstarting with Excel
## For this project we were assigned to help our friend, Louise. Louise's passionate and steamy new play *Fever* is gearing up to set box offices ablaze. There was just one small problem... how can she afford to put it on? 
### Louise wanted to crowdfund her play so we were tasked with analyzing data from more than 4,000 individual Kickstarter campaigns to identify key trends and help come up with a competitive fundraising strategy.
## Analysis and Challenges 
### We filtered the data for specifically theatrical productions and further more, the months in which the shows were put on.

### Based off the data collected, the conclusion was that summer shows have a much higher percentage chance of being successful than one in spring or the winter.
